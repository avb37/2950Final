    "I know that I want to cluster my data in different ways, but the more I think about clustering, the more I realize more creative I will need to be. \n",

    "Here are some thoughts I have: \n",
    "\n",
    "If I want to cluster my results by language the way we clusted by penguin species in the homework, I would need a large collection of data that has data points from a collection of languages and see if there is a relationship between a data point's language and whatever else I am measuring. In the homework, we had Bill Length on the x axis, Flipper length on the y axis, and we attempted to cluster by species.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've decided the first analysis I will do is look at the historical influence of the Ottoman Empire on languages. I want to see if there is a relationship between the distance a country has from Turkey and the amount of words in common with the Turkish language. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think what I will do is clean up the datasets I have and merge them into one large dataset. This dataset will have this per row: a word in english, a column for each translation (if it exists) into the languages I am analyzing. It will look like:\n",
    "[word]x[lang1]x[lang2]x[lang3]...\n",
    "\n",
    "I will transpose this into a new table that has these columns: \n",
    "[word]x[translation]x[language]x[city]x[distance from Istanbul]x[number letters in common]x[percentage in common]\n",
    "for each word even if it repeats so that each row only has one language. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the x axis I will have the number of letters in common and on the y axis I will have the percentage that is. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will perform two clustering analyses, one by language, and one by city/distance.\n",
